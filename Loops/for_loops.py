# A for loop is used for iterating over a sequence (that is either a list, a tuple, a dictionary, a set, or a string).
# why we not used in for loop "i+=1"--> because for take automatically take next value

# for example list in for loops
print("example list in for loops")
lis = [1, 3, 4, 2, 5, 6]
print(type(lis))  # output is type od lis -->class 'list'>

for i in lis:  # i is used for take one element from lis
    print(i)  # out put is --> 1,3,4,2,5,6


# for loops example on tuples

print("\nfor loops example on tuples\n")
fruit = ("bananna", "apple", "mango", "orangr", "wartermelon")
print(type(fruit))  # out put is <class 'tuple'>

for n in fruit:
    print(n)  # output-->"bananna","apple","mango","orangr","wartermelon"

    # example of string in for loops

print("\nexample of string in for loops\n")
str = "jawad Ahmad"
for j in str:
    print(j)  # output --> j a w a d  A h m a d
